I am a programmer and game designer based off Salvador, Bahia. I&amp;rsquo;m studying game development as an undergrad at the State University of Bahia and my main research interests lie at the intersection between game and web technologies.
Unity3D is my weapon of choice and C# is my main programming language, but I also know little bit of golang, Node.js, and Docker.
I am also disabled.</description></item></channel></rss>
